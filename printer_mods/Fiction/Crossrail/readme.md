**Bill of materials**
 - 2 x DRP-03 DIN rail power supply plate (Mouser, Digikey, Time, Ebay, powersuppliesonline.co.uk etc) cut down so that one will be static and the other has the spring
 - 8 x M4x6 socket button head screws

**Notes**
The DIN rails need to be spaced 120mm apart centre-to-centre (85mm gap)
